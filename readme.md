Example render based on the [Scans Island](https://krynski.artstation.com/projects/DAKRZE) project by Art Director &
Concept Artist [Piotr Krynski](https://krynski.artstation.com/). Modified to have a camera flying around the
environment.

## Description

DAS Blender Render is built in native Python 3.6 except for the PyYAML package which is used to parse .yaml files. It
uses Blender 3.3 LTS as the designated Blender version. Designed for usage on DAS-6.

## Deploy

Deploying the system requires the following steps:

1. Clone the project to the `/home/$USER` directory.
2. Change the chmod permissions of deploy.sh
3. Execute deploy.sh, first value is the master node, following values are workers. For
   example `deploy.sh node301,node302,node303`
4. Initiate a Blender client by setting up a `config.yaml` file (use `example-config.yaml` as reference).
   See `async-blender-call.py` for example.
5. Execute the blender client.

## Development

1. Clone the project
2. Copy the `example-config.yaml` and rename it to `config.yaml`.
3. Start the `test/master-test.py`
4. Start the `test/worker-test.py`
5. A cluster has now been started. You can create a new client to execute a blender render, See `async-blender-call.py`
   for example.
